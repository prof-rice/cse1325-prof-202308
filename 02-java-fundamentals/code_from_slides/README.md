# Structured Programming in Java

You are probably comfortable by now with implementing structured programs
in the C programming language. A "structured" program uses data structures
and functions to organize the code to implement the requirements.

To help you with the transition to Java, let's first see how to do the
structured programming techniques with which you should already be familiar
in the Java programming language. Since both languages are K&R* based,
you should find Java to be very similar, though not identical, to C.

Once you are comfortable with Java, and starting next lecture, 
we'll begin to learn a new *paradigm* or style of programming 
called "object-oriented".

*K&R stands for Kernighan and Ritchie, engineers and authors who popularized
the C programming language. A K&R language uses curly braces to define scope
(such as for an if statement), semicolons to terminate statements, 
3-term for loops, and similar syntax.
