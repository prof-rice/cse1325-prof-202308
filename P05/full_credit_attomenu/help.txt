About the Library Management System
===================================

The LMS was written to assist busy librarians with tracking library resources
without overwhelming them with training and complex interfaces. 

Each resource tracked by the system may be checked out to a named patron when
loaned out and then checked by in when returned. Lists of all tracked resources
and their status are available at any time.

From the main menu, the following options are offered:

l -> List Publications
o -> Check Out
i -> Check In
p -> New Publication
v -> New Video
? -> this help text
? _ -> help on the menu item represented by _
x -> Exit the system

#
List Publications
=================

Each resource is identified by its LMS ID (a positive integer), title, author, 
and copyright date. Video resources also include a runtime in minutes.

For example,

0) Book "Foundation" by Isaac Asimov, copyright 1951
1) Video "Citizen Kane" by Orson Welles, copyright 1941, runtime 119 minutes

If a resource has been checked out, a second line of text will identify
the patron who has that resource and the date it is due to be returned.

#
Check Out
=========

Check out behaves differently in 3 scenarios.

1. If no resources are currently in the library, the message 

    No publications available for checkout

will be displayed, and the librarian will be returned to the main menu.

2. If only one resource is currently available for check out in the library, 
it will be automatically selected. 

3. If two or more resources are currently available for check out in the library, 
all resources managed by the LMS that are available for check out will be listed 
similar to List Publications (with a new, temporary LMS ID), and the librarian 
will be prompted to select a resource using the tempoarary LMS ID. The librarian
may enter 'x' to cancel the check out with the message

    Selection for check out cancelled

Once the resource has been selected, the librarian will be asked to type 
a line of text identifying the patron who is checking out the resource. 
The full name and some identifying information such as phone number,
email address, or driver's license / ID card number is suggested.

The selected resource will then be marked as checked out, and its updated
status including due date will be displayed.

#
Check In
========

Check in behaves differently in 3 scenarios.

1. If no resources are currently in the library, the message 

    No publications available for checkin

will be displayed, and the librarian will be returned to the main menu.

2. If only one resource is currently available for check in in the library, 
it will be automatically selected. 

3. If two or more resources are currently available for check in in the library, 
all resources managed by the LMS that are available for check in will be listed 
similar to List Publications (with a new, temporary LMS ID), and the librarian 
will be prompted to select a resource using the tempoarary LMS ID. The librarian
may enter 'x' to cancel the check in.

Once the resource has been selected, that resource will then be marked as 
checked in, and its updated status will be displayed.
