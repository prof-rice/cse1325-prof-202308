Lecture 06
==========

String Demo
-----------

This class provides examples for all of the String methods you'll need to know for the assignments and exam.

String Builder vs String
------------------------

This file enables you to time the use of Java's StringBuilder vs String for whatever operations you'd like to define, calculating which is faster and by what percentage. By default, it reverses a 1000-character String.

A version for StringBuffer is also provided, although we rarely use StringBuffer. (StringBuffer is thread-safe, but it's usually more optimal to protect operations ourselves using... well, stick around for Lecture 15!)

ArrayList vs Array
------------------

This demo compares classic C-like arrays to Java's ArrayList class.

Stack Explorer is also provided, although we won't be learning or using Stack this semester. Around Lecture 14, we'll learn the ArrayDeque ("array deck"), which is a much more powerful and flexible stack-like class.

Class Relationships
-------------------

This UML class diagram and simple Java implementation demonstrate the key relationships between classes that we discussed in lecture.

The UML diagram is provided in Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) and Portable Network Graphics (PNG) formats, as well as PlantUML code.

The UML diagram specified in class.uml and shown in class.png and class.svg may be found on-line at the following URL. You may edit the [PlantUML code] online and click Submit to edit the diagram.
