Writing a Threaded, Object-Oriented, Graphical User Interface Application

Mandelbrot equation (in complex plane x+yi):

  f(z) = zÂ² + c
  
If the absolute value of the function does not diverge when calculated recursively, the value c is a member of the Mandelbrot set.
We can use the number of iterations of the function before the absolute value exceeds a value (we'll use 2) 
    to determine the color of a pixel (x, y) that corresponds to the constant x+yi.


Code for Mandlelbrot set calculations can be found on the Internet at the following locations:

* This link provides Mandelbrot implementations in every language you've ever seen and a lot you have not! Bash? Seriously???

https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set

* The classic freeware fractint implementation for DOS (and DOSBox under Windows) with a native port to Linux

https://www.fractint.org/

* This is a good public domain implementation in C
