P10 - Time to Overload Operators!
=================================

This directory will NOT compile until you write Time.h and Time.cpp 
to conform to the supplied requirements.

After writing the header file Time.h, you can test-compile it using 
``make TestTime.o``. If your header file has the correct interface 
to work with TestTime.cpp, you will receive no errors and TestTime.o 
will be created.

After writing the body file Time.cpp, use ``make`` to produce the 
executable  and ``./testtime`` to execute it. No output indicates 
success. (I recommend that you intentionally add a few bugs temporarily 
to your code and ensure the regression test detects them before 
concluding your code works!)
