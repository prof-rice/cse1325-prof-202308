QUESTION 1: Why is String[] args changed to a LinkedList in WordSearch.main? (Hint: Examine the WordSearch constructor!)




QUESTION 2: How many puzzles did your machine need to solve with 1 thread to run for between 30 and 45 seconds: 




QUESTION 3: Provide the output of 

    time java WordSearch n 1000 ../puzzle??.txt 

where n is 1 to 16 and 1000 is the number of puzzles specified in Question 2. NOTE: You can run all of these with a single bash command if you like (again, replace 1000 with your number of puzzles from Question 2):

for i in {1..16} ; do time java WordSearch $i 1000 ../puzzle??.txt ; done

Example Timing:

 for i in {1..16} ; do time java WordSearch $i 1000 ../puzzle??.txt ; done

YOUR Timing:







QUESTION 3: Does adding more threads continue to speed up the program? Do more threads ever slow down the program even slightly?  Why or why not?






QUESTION 4: Does adding more threads increase the "system load" (sys), or is it constant regardless of the number of threads?  Why?
